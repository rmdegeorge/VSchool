            <h3>Meet Jasper</h3>
            <p>Jasper’s journey with yoga has taken her around the world. She first discovered yoga more than eight years ago. What initially started as a simple physical exercise quickly transformed into a powerful way to connect to, love, and heal the body and mind. Yoga made such a massive impact on her life that Jasper knew she needed to share it. </p>
            <p>She traveled to India in 2017, studied Ashtanga, Vinyasa, Myofascial Release, Meditation, and Pranayama. She went on to teach in Melbourne, Australia before making her way back to the US. Jasper is an RYT® 500 who brings creative flow, anatomical awareness, mindfulness, passion, and loads of love and kindness to every class. Are you ready to make a positive change in your life? Get in touch today to experience the empowering, transformational practice of yoga.</p>
