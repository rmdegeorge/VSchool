                Why yoga?
            </h3>
            <p>The tradition of yoga can be traced back 5,000 years, and has since been through a dramatic evolution. Usually, when we think of yoga today, we think of the physical postures, or asana. Asana is just one part of the ancient system of yoga as conceived by the Indus-Sarasvati civilization in Northern India. The word "yoga" translates to "union", and that is still the goal of this practice today.</p>
            <p>The main pieces of a vinyasa yoga practice include mindful breath linked to movement, introspection, and meditative focus. Yoga strengthens the connection, or union, of mind and body. Practices that strengthen the mind body connection have been linked to amazing benefits that extend far beyond the yoga mat.</p>
            <p>Studies have shown that yoga improves physical fitness, strength, and flexibility. However, the benefits of a consistent yoga practice extend even farther.  Yoga has been shown to reduce stress and inflammation. Yoga can prevent and improve anxiety and depression. A regular yoga practice has even been linked to healthier eating habits, improved body image, and better sleep.</p>
            <p>Try it for yourself and experience the benefits of this ancient practice. I offer group classes in Salt Lake City at Full Circle Yoga and Avenues Yoga. If you prefer a focused, personal approach, reach out for a free consultation on private classes tailored to your unique goals and needs. I also offer corporate classes, so you can but the benefits of yoga to work for you and your colleagues. Get in touch today to learn how you can make a change in your mind, body, and overall quality of life!</p>
