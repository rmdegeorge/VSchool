            <p><span class="smallcaps">Salt Lake City, UT</span> -- Against all odds, it seems that 
                <span class="bold">Rob DeGeorge</span> -- a current V School student -- has actually learned something. 
                After lots of banging his head against the table and claiming he would use 
                his very expensive laptop as a very effective tool for creating a hole in the 
                window, Rob has reportedly learned some basic HTML and CSS code. According to 
                an anonymous source, he may have even learned some super basic Javascript. 
                This report has yet to be confirmed, but shows that he may actually be able 
                to survive the coming months after all.</p>
